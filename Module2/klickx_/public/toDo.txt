1) Router is not working right after clicking the any button- requires refresh everytime - how will it 
store the logged in status? 
2) Images are not displayed.
3) Register page - take the data and create a user and keep that user in the browser memory
4) While logging in successful, keep the user name and display it into the next userHome page
5) While displaying image, grab the comments, likes.
6) Change the login and logout based on the login status in the side bar. 
6) Delete the user account - 

User story - Register a user, Login - post comments, likes, dislikes, delete the comments and the user
User story - already available users - you should be able to see the fav pages, profile pages, except
deleting her/him self, should be able to delete the comments. 


function logout() {
    // remove user from local storage to log user out
    localStorage.removeItem('user');
}

1) Image component is not rendering - this.props is undefined I used only map
2) How to login using the new Register credentials? HOw to access these state? If I use mapSateToProps
will it correctly connect to RegusterUSer Reducer and bring that data?
