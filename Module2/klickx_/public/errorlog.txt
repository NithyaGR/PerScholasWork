questions to ask Jade

Redux - where to store the data.
users - have the data ready, how to store photos, where? 
css  - why the the flex grow doesn't work
want app to look only the components rendering - no codes inside. How to do that?
How to make the register page link to a button? RElate to mastermind
How to render a component on onClick event?
Though the router taking to the new page, the previous page contents are there. How to resolve. 


Can i keep those handleSubmit and onChange methods globally in Redux as well? I'm thinking. 
I believe there can't be 2 exports of state in reducers - klickx_reducers - 
I have 2 data .js. How to handle them

each and every action needs to be separate? Or can we combine? Like add comment or delete comment? I mean in different action .js or single? 

should we use constructor explicitly? 
Should we use bind ?
Verify my data. How to call them in the code?

  I need to enclose the data file winthin single or double quotes

  in reducers - users was not defined message - 
  You SHOULD export the data from the data file. export default users
  also include import users from './users.js'

Error: Reducer "users" returned undefined during initialization. If the state passed to the reducer is undefined,
 you must explicitly return the initial state. The initial 
state may not be undefined. If you don't want to set a value for this reducer, you can use null instead of undefined.

-- Use default switch case

ReferenceError: Cannot access 'LOGIN_USER' before initialization




Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {users, changeLoginStatus}). 
If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.







In your app - you should have your <home page> first- set private path , then login then register

 Line 48:20:  React Hook "useHistory" cannot be called in a class component. React Hooks must be called in a React function component or a custom React Hook function  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks

 history is not exported error - when I used router history={history} in app.js - got this error


 moved this to index.js
react_devtools_backend.js:2430 Warning: <BrowserRouter> ignores the history prop. To use a custom history, use `import { Router }` instead of `import { BrowserRouter as Router }`.

    state not iterable :

    Comments: [...state.Comments, action.payload] this is right 
    I used [Comments]: [..state, action.payload] this is wrong, thats why got that error
